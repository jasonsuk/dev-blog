## Project motivation

<a id="motivation"></a>

This application is made to archive summaries, ideas and works as a result of my development journey.

I am particularly interested in exploring business problems with data science and machine learning, and the deployment of my analysis works on the web applications.

Welcome to my application and I always welcome you to inspire me with better ideas and workarounds 🤝! Thank you.

## File description

<a id="files"></a>

The application is based on MERN stack. React used for the client side (frontend) and MongoDB, Express and Node for the server side (backend)

There are two main folders:

-   `frontend`

    The client side codes using `React` framework along with Redux and Hook for state management.

-   `backend`

    The server side codes based on `Node / Express` connected to `MongoDB` database (using Mongoose Object Document Mapper)
